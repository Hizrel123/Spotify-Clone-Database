🎵 Spotify Clone Database Project

Welcome to my Spotify Clone SQL Database project!This project simulates the backend structure of a music streaming service like Spotify.It was built as part of my self-learning journey towards becoming a professional Database Administrator (DBA).

📌 Overview

This SQL project includes a fully structured relational database that mimics the functionality of a music streaming platform.It supports data about users, artists, albums, songs, genres, playlists, and listening activity.

💾 Database Structure

The database includes the following tables:

Users – Stores listener info

Artists – Contains details about music artists

Albums – Albums released by artists

Songs – Tracks belonging to albums and genres

Genres – Classifications like Afrobeats, Hip-Hop, etc.

Playlists – Created by users, contains multiple songs

PlaylistTracks – Tracks within each playlist

ListeningHistory – Tracks what songs users have played

Relationships are set using foreign keys to reflect real-world connections between data.

📊 Sample Queries Included

This project includes a wide range of SQL queries that demonstrate both basic and advanced skills:

🧮 Aggregate queries (e.g. most played songs, total listening time)

🔍 Filtering by genre, date, and user

🔁 Joins across multiple tables

🔗 Subqueries (nested queries)

🧠 Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

📈 Playlist engagement tracking

📊 Genre popularity analysis

🛠️ Tech Stack

Database Engine: MySQL

Tools Used: MySQL Workbench

Language: SQL (DDL + DML + advanced queries)
